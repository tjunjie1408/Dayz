# Product Guidelines

## Design Philosophy
- **Glassmorphism**: Utilize translucent layers, background blurs, and subtle borders to create depth and hierarchy.
- **Minimalism**: Prioritize content over chrome. Use whitespace generously to guide the user's focus.
- **Clarity**: Ensure that tracking data (days, streaks) is instantly readable and unambiguous.

## User Experience (UX) Principles
- **Seamless Interactions**: Animations should be smooth and reinforce the physical model of the glass layers.
- **Direct Manipulation**: Allow users to interact directly with tracking cards (e.g., tap to reset, swipe to edit).
- **Non-Intrusive**: Notifications and alerts should be helpful, not nagging.

## Visual Identity
- **Theme**: "Soft & Airy" - Use soft pastel gradients and light backgrounds to create a calming atmosphere.
- **Typography**: Clean sans-serif fonts (e.g., Roboto, Inter) for maximum legibility.
- **Iconography**: Thin, linear icons that complement the minimalist aesthetic.

## Brand Voice
- **Professional & Direct**: The app communicates with precision and respect for the user's time.
- **Objective**: Feedback on streaks and milestones is factual and encouraging without being overly emotional.
- **Concise**: All text, from labels to onboarding, should be brief and to the point.
